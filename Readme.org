#+TITLE: Blue Green ECS Service with custom CloudFormation
#+DATE: Thu Sep 12 18:50:12 +0545 2019

*** Why custom ECS Service
  AWS ECS Service supports three types of Deployment Controller([[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentController.html][For More Details]]):
  - ECS (default)
  - CODE_DEPLOY(blue/green)
  - EXTERNAL

    We can set CODE_DEPLOY as deployment controller and achieve BLUE/GREEN deployment of the ECS Service unfortunately there is no support to manipulate DeploymentController properties through Cloudformation. You should either use API/CLI or build your own custom cloudformation.

**** Creating Custom BG ECS service
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   git clone https://github.com/BalmanRawat/bgECSService.git
   export SAM_SOURCE_BUCKET=<your-sam-bucket>
   export STACK_NAME=<your-stack-name>
   cd create-ecs-service
   make package
   make deploy
   #+END_SRC

*** Why custom deployment group
    AWS CloudFormation Doesn't have native support for the ECS type Blue/Green DeploymentGroup.
